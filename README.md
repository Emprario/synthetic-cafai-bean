# IML project ;  EFREI Paris X APU

# Getting Started
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict a specific variable.
Here is the dataset used :  [www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/global-coffee-health-dataset/data)


* Predict health_issues from other data - excluding ID (classification)
* Predict stress_level from other data - excluding ID (classification)
* Regression for sleep_hours
* Regression for coffee_intake or caffeine_mg


## Prerequisites

You will need the libraries listed in [requirements](requirements.txt)

To install them, go into your command prompt and type 
```cmd 
pip install [LIBRARY_NAME]
```
## Usage
You just need to press `run` lmaooo
